In this short notebook, I use Zillow data from Quandl and geographic zip code data provided by the city of Los Angeles to create a map of home value percentile. 

Plotting the data this way reveals a negative correlation between distance from coast and Zillow home value. This is particularly evident for zip codes located directly on the coast, all of which are in the top 20 percentile of Zillow home prices. 

Of course, there are deviations from the simple correlation of home value and distance from coast. For example, areas including and surrounding Hollywood, the mecca of the film industry in the US, have high Zillow home values despite their greater distance from the coast.
